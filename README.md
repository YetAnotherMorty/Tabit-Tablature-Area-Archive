# Tabit-Tablature-Area-Archive

Ever since Tabit's Tablature Area went down, with no sign of any the original tablature area to be transfered over to the new servers, a [recent mirror](https://tabarea.net/tabs/list.php@f=3.html) has come up, and is where people are now uploading and maintaining their tasks. This archive will attempt to host those tabit files.
